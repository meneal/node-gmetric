# node-gmetric [![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jbuchbinder/node-gmetric.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/jbuchbinder/node-gmetric)

## meneal's modified node gmetric

jbuchbinder's code did not suit my needs since post connections it does not close the sockets it opens for communication.  It may well be that he had some specific way in mind to close out the connections, but that wasn't obvious from his readme, or the documentation in the code.  

This mod closes the connections after each socket sends it's packets.  Any time there is a new call it simply opens up another socket.  Two are used for each send to ganglia, one for meta and one for data.

Gmetric packet submission for node.js

## Sending metrics

### Unspoofed

```javascript
var Gmetric = require('gmetric');

var gmetric = new Gmetric();
var metric = {
  hostname: 'awesomehost.mydomain.com',
  group: 'testgroup',
  units: 'widgets/sec',
  slope: 'positive',

  name: 'bestmetric',
  value: 10,
  type: 'int32'
};

gmetric.send('127.0.0.1', 8649, metric);
```

### Spoofed

```javascript
var Gmetric = require('gmetric');

var gmetric = new Gmetric();
var metric = {
  hostname: '192.168.20.15:awesomehost.mydomain.com',
  group: 'testgroup',
  spoof: true,
  units: 'widgets/sec',
  slope: 'positive',

  name: 'bestmetric',
  value: 10,
  type: 'int32'
};

gmetric.send('127.0.0.1', 8649, metric);
```

## Receiving and unpacking metrics

```javascript
var util = require('util'),
    dgram = require('dgram'),
    server = dgram.createSocket('udp4');

var Gmetric = require('gmetric'),
    gmetric = new Gmetric();

server.on('message', function(msg, rinfo) {
  var msg_type = msg.readInt32BE(0);
  if(msg_type === 128){
    var meta = gmetric.unpack(msg);
    console.log('Received Meta Packet:');
    console.log(util.inspect(meta) + "\n");
  } else if (msg_type === 133){
    var data = gmetric.unpack(msg);
    console.log('Received Data Packet:');
    console.log(util.inspect(data) + "\n");
  }
});

server.on('listening', function(){
  console.log('Gmetric server listening...');
});

server.bind(8649);
```
